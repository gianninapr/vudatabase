A Database and UI for Villanova University's Eclipsing Binary Card Catalogue
============================================================================
This project uses the Django Framework to create a database for the eclipsing
binary card catalogue stored in the Department of Astrophysics and Planetary
Sciences at Villanova University. This project also includes a data entry
interface through Django's Admin website functionality, and a dynamic HTML
online catalog tied to the database. Images of the database schema and the
resulting UIs can be found at the bottom of this text.

Most scripts contain sufficient amount of comments, but more documentation will
be added as a per-file basis soon.


Things to Work On
=================

This was my first coding project therefore there are a few things that need to
be cleaned in terms of static directories, and syntax needs to be normalized,
which will also be done as soon as possible. Things that need to be done:

* The data-entry process needs to begin so that we can see where the database
  needs tweaking

* CSS should be added to the dynamic HTML template to refine the presentation
  of the output catalog.
